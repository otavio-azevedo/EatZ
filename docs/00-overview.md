# Introduction

In a scenario where, on the one hand, we have malnutrition and food insecurity affecting thousands of people globally, on the other hand, we have food waste in the proportion of thousands of tons in Brazil alone. In the context of food service and retail establishments such as restaurants, bakeries, markets and hotels that produce food on a daily basis, predicting the amount of food that should be made available to maximize profits without generating financial losses is a complex task. In this sense, this project proposes the development of a technological solution to reduce food waste. The proposal consists of creating a multiplatform application to connect these establishments to people interested in consuming these foods, which should be offered at reduced prices within the platform. Through this application, the aim is to establish a direct link between supply and demand for surplus food, reducing waste and contributing to the construction of a more efficient and equitable food system. Resources similar to this are already part of the daily lives of thousands of people on the European continent, in Brazil it is still a segment unknown by the majority and with great potential for growth.

## Goals
This study proposes the implementation and evaluation of a
complete cross-platform application, following the best engineering practices
of current software and agile development, aiming to contribute to the reduction
of food waste. As a result, it is hoped that in the end it will be
deliverable the solution prototype in Minimum Viable Product â€“ MVP format.
### Specific Goals
In addition to the general objective of the work, below are the following specific goals:
- a) Research and analysis of the business opportunity in the local market;
- b) Modeling of the architecture of the solution;
- c) Development of the prototype;
- d) Evaluation of the behavior of the prototype from tests
automated.

Therefore, based on the aforementioned objectives, this work will be structured
initially by the theoretical foundation chapter, contemplating all the
bibliographic reference used and the methodology is presented below. Finally,
we have the analysis of the results obtained and the final considerations with the improvements
possible in future work based on this study.

## Escope
This work aims to develop a technological solution to connect these establishments to interested consumers.
